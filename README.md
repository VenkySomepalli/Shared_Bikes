# Shared_Bikes
I Build a model to predict the shared bikes demand with the available independent variables (features).
It will be used by the company or management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and reach the customer's expectations.

I follow the CRISP(MLQ) Procedure:
